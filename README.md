# SEEC Stats Toolbox Seminar on meta-analysis

As the number of scientific studies continues to grow exponentially, so does the opportunity to gain insights on a specific hypothesis using data from a large number different studies. Literature reviews are useful for providing a synthesis on the current understanding of a particular research topic, but are largely qualitative in nature and are unable to quantitatively assess conflicting results from different studies.
Meta-analysis provides a statistical framework for combining and comparing different studies to test a specific research hypothesis.

In this SEEC Stats Toolbox Seminar you will find out about:

  1. how to conduct a rigorous meta-analysis,
  2. learn what effect sizes are in meta-analyses,
  3. find out about useful R packages and tools for conducting meta-analyses.
